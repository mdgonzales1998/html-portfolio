<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael Gonzales</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dune Part 2</h3>
<p>
    Recently saw this movie and was absolutely fantastic. Love the sci-fi, the
    characters, the pacing, the action, all of it is just so compelling and
    gripping. I can definetly tell how modern sci-fi and Star Wars were inspired
    by Dune
</p>

<h3>Tron Legacy</h3>
<p>
    Pure nostalgia pick here. Love the super tech vibes, the story is also
    fairly good. Acting is wonderful and the action is very fun.

<h3>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>
    The animation of this movie is absolutely insane. Ufotable highly elevated
    the source material and made the show super compelling and just beautiful.
    Demon Slayer in general has become a new standard for shonen action
    animation.
