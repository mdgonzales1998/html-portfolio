<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    Hey! My name is Michael Gonzales. I'm a young software developer in the
    Greater Boston area. I'm currently working at Blue Cross Blue Shield of
    Massachusetts as a Provider Ops Developer, creating tools to automate
    different processes using the .NET Framework and generating reports using
    SQL, Microsoft Access, and C# for data analysts. I am a jack of all trades
    when it comes to software development, having spent two years in college
    focusing on Java, two years on C++, two years of Python at a robotics lab at
    the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and most recently two years of
    professional C# experience. I am also an avid gamer and dream of working in
    Game Development one day. I have created a Dungeons and Dragons Initiative
    tracker as my capstone in College as well as worked at a small start up
    developing a 2D side-scroller in Unity. I love to learn different software
    development tools and I am currently working on learning more about Full
    Stack Development and Unreal Engine 5 development in my free time.
</p>

    In my spare time, as mentioned I love to play video games. Recently I have
    been playing First-Person Shooter games like Apex Legends, Role-Playing
    Games like Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy VII: Remake, and Persona 5:
    Royale. I am also an avid reader and amature writer. I love fantasy, Brandon
    Sanderson's works within his connected universe of the Cosmere (The
    Stormlight Archives, Mistborn, Warbreaker) along with the works of The
    Miller Brothers (The Codebearers), Frank E. Peretti (This Present Darkness),
    and Rick Riordan (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Heroes of Olympus) are
    some of my favorites. If I couldn't get any more nerdier, I greatly enjoy
    playing Tabletop Role-Playing Games like Dungeons and Dragons, Blades in the
    Dark, and Vampire the Masquerade to name a few.
</p>

    Another fun fact about me is that I have playing drums sicne 2012. I played
    in a few ensembles growing up, but most of my playing experience was either
    in church or the worship ensemble at my high school. I am an avid Christian
    and one day I plan on combining all that I've discussed here, software
    development, video games, writing, and the fantasy genre, into one large
    project. There have been no or few high quality video games that have some
    relation to Christianity, and I want to change that. I want to create
    something the likes of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, a work of fiction with
    biblical undertones that can be enjoyed by the Christian and Non-Christian.
    I will use this page to display my progress as I learn how to use Unreal
    Engine, posting different projects I create. While I learn how to be a Full
    Stack Developer, building fun and complex websites and to hopefully get a
    job in the field while I create my video games on the side.
</p>

<p>
    That's me in a nutshell or three. Please look around my portfolio and let me
    know what you think of the different projects I create! <br />
    Regards,<br />
    Michael Gonzales
